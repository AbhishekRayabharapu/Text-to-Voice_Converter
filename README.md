# Text-to-Voice_Converter 
<p> The idea of this project is to convert the written text into audio it can convert the text into some inbuilt voices</p>
<p> I have used html,css,javascript. it has a simple html and has a appealing background styles. the js code used is pretty simple one.</p>
<p> i have used a  Web Speech API that helps in converting the text to speech. it has a inbuilt function called SpeechSynthesisUtterance() through which it makes a request to read the entered text. i have used the windows built in voices and used a for each loop to loop through the available voices and on selecting it the voice will be used</p>
